My name is Emily. 
```{r}
library(ggvis)
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

```

I counted `r 1 + 1` red trucks on the highway.

The arithmetic mean is equal to $\frac{1}{n} \sum{i=i}^{n} x_{i}$, or the summation of n numbers divided by n.

```{r}
xval <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
yval <- c(8,3,2,5,8)
df <- data.frame(xval, yval)

df %>% ggvis(x = ~xval, y = ~yval) %>% layer_points()

```


```{r}
flights %>% left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>% 
  droplevels() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%  
  ggvis(x = ~name, y = ~arr_delay, fill = ~name) %>% layer_boxplots()

```
